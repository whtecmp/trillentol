Need to use the macro create-menu!
To do so we need to change the opening gui creator to use create actor.
Also need to add to the menu chooser, that upon creation, it will also create its options.
For every option an upon choice action should be written.
...
Then there will be bugs in the macro as it is yet to be tested. But the architecture is sound.
